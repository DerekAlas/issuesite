      <h2>PRESENT/FUTURE</h2>
      <div id="paragraph">
        <p>While filmmaking is an artform, it’s also a business and big studios like Disney and Warner Bros. are the ones who run it. I think it’s safe to assume the reason so many unoriginal films are being made is because they stem from products that have proven to make money -- and that is the number one concern for the studios.</p>
        <p>It makes sense: why put a ton of money into something that could potentially underperform at the box office? Why not just invest in something you know the public will want and you know will make a profit? This seems logical, but there is still a victim of this mentality: artists who don’t yet have a foot in the door.</p>
        <p>Filmmakers who have already had a chance to prove their talent are going to get hired to direct films that are already on the path to make money. This leaves out the whole younger generation who never even had a chance to prove themselves. And as for the future, who knows? Maybe technology will advance so much that AI can take over…</p>
