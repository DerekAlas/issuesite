      <h2>PAST</h2>
      <div id="paragraph">
        <p>From the moment of its creation right up until the turn of the century, the art of filmmaking was alive and well. It wasn’t a leap of faith to think an independent filmmaker could break into the industry. Many of the biggest filmmakers did just that.</p>
        <p>While franchises, sequels, and remakes were still around and being made, they didn’t dominate the box offices. In 1975, a film set the record for the highest grossing film of all time. This film was Steven Spielberg’s Jaws. In 1977, the record was set again by George Lucas’s Star Wars. Nowadays, you could argue Star Wars is a part of the issue, but back then, it was a wholly original film. It’s hard to imagine something like this happening again.</p>
        <p>Before, people used to flood the theaters for the latest Alfred Hitchcock thriller. Now, people wait for the next live action remake to land on Disney+.</p>
